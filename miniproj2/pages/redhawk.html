    <h2>The Red-Shouldered Hawk</h2>

    <div class="crab">
        The red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) is a medium-sized hawk. Its breeding range spans eastern North America
        and along the coast of California and northern to northeastern-central Mexico. It is a permanent resident
        throughout most of its range, though northern birds do migrate, mostly to central Mexico. The main conservation
        threat to the widespread species is deforestation.
