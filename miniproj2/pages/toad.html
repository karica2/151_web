    <h2>The Common Toad</h2>

    <div class="crab">
        <div class="flavortext">
            The common toad, European toad, or in Anglophone parts of Europe, simply the toad (Bufo bufo, from Latin
            bufo
            "toad"), is a frog found throughout most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Iceland, and some
            Mediterranean islands), in the western part of North Asia, and in a small portion of Northwest Africa. It is
            one
            of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of toads and which
            form a
            species complex. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes
            active
            at dusk and spends the night hunting for the invertebrates on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly
            walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.
