    <h2>Short-Tailed Hawk</h2>

    <div class="crab">
        Short-tailed hawks breed in the tropical and subtropical Americas from southeastern Brazil and northern
        Argentina north through Central America to the mountains of the Mexico-Arizona border area, as well as in
        southern Florida, United States; it is also found on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. This species is generally
        found below 4,500 ft (1,400 m) ASL and most common below 2,500 ft (760 m). It is replaced by the white-throated
        hawk (B. albigula) in the Andes of southern Colombia and south to central Argentina and Chile; the short-tailed
        hawk is found in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, while B. albigula occurs south of
        these locales. As far as is known, B. brachyurus is a year-round resident except that most of the Florida
        population migrates in winter to the southern tip of the state, including the Keys. It is somewhat habitat
        adaptable but only passes areas with dense human populations when foraging. The species may be found in wooded
        savannah, patchy woodlands near water, cypress swamps, mangrove swamps or high pine-oak woodlands. In the
        tropics, it is most common in lowland foothills.
