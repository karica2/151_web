### Algorithm for Kenan's line art

## Steps

1. draw a line with an X coordinate of the 50% of the wall width. It should stretch vertically from 25% to 75% of the height. 
2. create a square whose center is at the exact center of the wall. the size of the square's sides should be 10% of the wall's height. 
3. Draw two lines vertically that begin at 40% of the wall's height and end at 60% of the height, one placed at an X coordinate of 45% of the wall's width, and the other at 55%. 
4. Draw two lines that stretch vertically from 15% of the wall height to 85% of the wall height. One should be at an X coordinate of 5% of the wall width, and the other at an X coordinate of 95% of the wall width.
